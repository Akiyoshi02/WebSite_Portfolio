# 💼 Akiyoshi Yapa — Portfolio

**Version 0.1.0 — Personal site & project showcase**

A production-ready portfolio for **Akiyoshi Yapa**, built with **Astro**, **TypeScript**, and **MDX**. The site presents work experience, education, featured projects, writing, and a contact flow in a single polished experience. Content is driven by Astro content collections, with SEO metadata, RSS, and a sitemap generated at build time.

The live site is deployed on **Netlify**. Contact submissions are delivered by email through a **Netlify Function** and your **SMTP** provider (no third-party form branding).

## 🛠️ Setup / Run

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22** (see `.nvmrc`)
- **npm**

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Akiyoshi02/WebSite_Portfolio.git
cd WebSite_Portfolio
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment variables

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `SITE_URL` | Recommended | Canonical URL for sitemap, RSS, and Open Graph (e.g. `https://akiyoshiyapa.netlify.app`) |
| `GH_TOKEN` | Optional | Live GitHub contribution data during `npm run build` |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | Yes for CMS/admin | Supabase project URL |
| `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | Yes for CMS/admin | Supabase anonymous key |
| `PUBLIC_ADMIN_EMAILS` | Yes for admin | Comma-separated emails allowed through the admin UI check |

**SMTP variables** (server-side only — set in Netlify, not prefixed with `PUBLIC_`):

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `SMTP_HOST` | Yes | Mail server hostname (e.g. `smtp.gmail.com`) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | No | Port (default `587`; use `465` with `SMTP_SECURE=true`) |
| `SMTP_SECURE` | No | `true` for TLS on port 465 |
| `SMTP_USER` | Yes | SMTP username / login |
| `SMTP_PASS` | Yes | SMTP password or app password |
| `SMTP_FROM` | Yes | From address (must be allowed by your provider) |
| `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` | No | Inbox for submissions (defaults to `akiyoshiyapa@gmail.com`) |

Do **not** commit `.env`.

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

For admin password recovery, add the local and production reset URLs to Supabase Auth redirect URLs, for example `http://localhost:3000/admin-panel/reset-password` and `https://your-site.example/admin-panel/reset-password`. Recovery links that land on the site root are forwarded to `/admin-panel/reset-password`.

Admin write access is enforced by Supabase RLS, not just the browser UI. Apply the latest SQL in `supabase/`, then keep `public.admin_users` limited to trusted admin email addresses.

### 5. Production build & preview

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Output is written to `dist/`.

## 🚀 Deployment (Netlify)

1. Connect this repository in the [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com/).
2. Confirm build settings (or use `netlify.toml`):

   | Setting | Value |
   |---------|--------|
   | Build command | `npm run build` |
   | Publish directory | `dist` |
   | Node version | `22` |

3. Add environment variables under **Site configuration → Environment variables** (including all SMTP variables above).
4. Deploy from `main`; Netlify rebuilds on each push.

### Test the contact form locally

`npm run dev` does not run Netlify Functions. Use the Netlify CLI:

```bash
npx netlify dev
```

Then open the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:8888`) and submit the form.

---

## 📬 Contact Form (SMTP)

1. Choose an SMTP provider (Gmail with an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833), Outlook, Zoho, or your domain host).
2. Add the SMTP variables to Netlify (and to `.env` when using `netlify dev`).
3. Ensure `SMTP_FROM` is an address your provider allows you to send from.

The browser posts JSON to `/.netlify/functions/contact`. The function validates input, ignores honeypot spam, and sends a plain-text email with **Reply-To** set to the visitor’s address.
